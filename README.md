### Hi, I'm @luybashu ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy uncovering patterns and insights from data.
With a scientific background in Neuroscience, Iâ€™m now focused on Data Analytics and Data Science, with a strong interest in data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

- ðŸ“Š Iâ€™m currently working on projects involving real-world datasets, exploring patterns through visual storytelling and classic machine learning techniques
- ðŸ¤– I apply interpretable ML models like regressions and gradient boosting, primarily to support deeper understanding, not just prediction
- ðŸŒ¿ Life goal: stay curious, open-minded, and well-rounded through continuous learning, time outdoors, and good books

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Connect with me on LinkedIn.
Iâ€™m open to collaborations and data-driven conversations!
